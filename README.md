# Figma-Like UI Design (HTML & CSS)

## Project Overview

This project is a web-based replica of a **Figma-like interface** built using only **HTML** and **CSS**. It includes a fully responsive header, sidebar sections, and a center area for scrolling content. The interface is intended to simulate the feel of a design tool workspace without the use of JavaScript for functionality.

## Features

- **Header Section**: Contains left, center, and right icons with clickable buttons and hover effects.
- **Sidebar Menus**: Both left and right sidebars have tools and options, designed using flexbox for alignment.
- **Center Scrollable Area**: A central content area that can scroll both horizontally and vertically.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts based on the viewport size to ensure proper alignment and structure.
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive hover effects for buttons and sidebar options.

## Folder Structure

- **Structure.html**: Contains the HTML structure for the page layout, including the header, left and right sidebars, and scrollable content area.
- **Style.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the layout, including flexbox positioning, hover effects, and responsive design elements.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `Structure.html` in your browser to view the UI.
3. The `Style.css` file is linked in the HTML file for styling.
